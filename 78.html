    <p>there are three main ways to brew coffee:
        <ul>
            <li id="#boiling">Boiling</li>
            <li id="#Steeping">Steeping</li>
            <li id="#Filteration Methods">Filteration Methods</li>


        </ul>
    </p>

    <h3 id="#boiling">Boiling</h3>
    <p>Millions of us count on coffeemakers to deliver the invigorating elixir of life. In fact, more than a few people can barely function at the most-basic level without their morning coffee.
    That's why kitchens around the world are stocked with coffee machines ranging from basic to extravagant. It's a rite of passage, or at the very least an everyday routine, to shuffle to the kitchen in a barely awake fog and stab the button on the coffee machine.
    Perhaps you are treated to freshly ground and roasted beans brewed in an elaborate digital thermal coffeemaker with built-in grinder. Or maybe you're low-maintenance and just want coffee and want it fast. That's all well and good, until the power goes out or the coffeemaker goes kaput. What now?
